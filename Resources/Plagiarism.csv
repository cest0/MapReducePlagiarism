11,Brunel,Test,2019,Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore  the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and CEO of Intel  whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit [2] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.
